# Day 2

## Read some documentation on the libraries of Data Science used. The reference was the Python official docs and also the book : Python Data Science Handbook written by Jake VanderPlas. A very well written book which can be used as a reference in times of need. Also, played with the Interactive Python Shell (known as ipython) and some other topics.
## The book is hosted online free of cost [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
## The repository having all the code related with the book is [here](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
## The link for the official Python3 documentation is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/)
