# Day 2

## Read some documentation on the libraries of Data Science used. The reference was the Python official docs and also the book : Python Data Science Handbook written by Jake VanderPlas. A very well written book which can be used as a reference in times of need. Also, played with the Interactive Python Shell (known as ipython) and some other topics.
